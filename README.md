# Task_2
 Binary Classification Problem - WideBot Intern Task 2019
 After cleaning the data and dealing with missing and catigorical data, I trained data with different 5 algorithms
 (Neural Networks, Logistic Regression , KNN , RandomForest and SVM)
 Best performance was with KNN method ( 69% Accuracy )
 
- I dealed with missing numerical data with "median" stratigy and with missing catigorical (String) data with "most-frequent" stratigy.
